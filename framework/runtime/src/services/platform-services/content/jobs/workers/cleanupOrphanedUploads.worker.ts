/**
 * Cleanup Orphaned Uploads Worker
 *
 * Purges incomplete uploads that were initiated but never completed.
 * An upload is considered orphaned if:
 * - sha256 is NULL (upload never completed)
 * - created_at is older than threshold (default 24 hours)
 *
 * Job runs hourly and:
 * 1. Finds orphaned attachment records
 * 2. Deletes S3 objects (if they exist)
 * 3. Deletes attachment records
 * 4. Emits audit events
